GROUP-2-ASSIGNMENT-IMAGE-PROCESSING

Sir, for the Teamwork & Collaboration (20%) criteria, we divided our responsibilities to ensure clear coordination and effective completion of the assignment, which focuses on applying thresholding techniques on three different images:

SITI FATIMAH BINTI ABDUL HAFFIDZ (Thresholding Analysis & Technical Implementation):

Implemented and tested the thresholding techniques for all three images, ensuring correct segmentation results.

Focused on Image 1 (kitab writing) by adjusting threshold values to clearly separate the text from the background.

Handled Image 2 (hand-drawn sketch) by refining thresholding to preserve line details and reduce noise.

TENGKU MOHAMAD AFHAM BIN TENGKU ZAKARIA (Image Selection, Evaluation & Documentation):

Prepared and organized the three images, including Image 3 (hand-drawn sketch with colors), and analyzed how color information affects thresholding results.

Evaluated the effectiveness of thresholding across all images and compared the segmentation outcomes.

Managed the documentation, explanation, and presentation of results to ensure clarity and alignment with the assignment requirements.

We worked collaboratively to discuss threshold selection, review segmentation results, and ensure that each image was processed accurately according to its characteristics.
